# Building-Energy-Anomaly-Detection
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in building electricity consumption using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify unusual energy usage patterns that may indicate inefficiencies, faults, abnormal system behavior, or energy wastage.
By analyzing time-series electricity consumption data, the model helps in proactive energy management, cost optimization, and predictive maintenance.
